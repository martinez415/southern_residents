# Souther Residents CLI App
A command-line interface app to educate users about the Southern Residentsâ€”a population of orcas (killer whales) that inhabit the northeastern Pacific Ocean, primarily around the coastal waters of Washington State and British Columbia. The app consists of three components: users can learn facts about each pod, play an interactive scenario game, and take a short quiz.

## Usage
Run ```ruby orca.app``` in the terminal.
